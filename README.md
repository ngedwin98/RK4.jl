# RK4
This package implements a fairly fast Runge-Kutta 4th order with fixed stepsize.
It also implements a stochastic solver that **is not** technically provably accurate, but works well for finite bandwidth SDE's.

Check out the [examples](file://examples) directory for some notebooks and their corresponding `.jl` files.
